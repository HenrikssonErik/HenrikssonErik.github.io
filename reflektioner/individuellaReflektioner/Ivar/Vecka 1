Q1: What do I want to learn or understand better?

- Right now, I don't have any particular experience from working with Scrum. Therefore, it would be really nice to learn how to work in a scrum environment.
To do this I'll have to try my best, listen to my group, and follow the given instructions from the lectures. 
- I also want to refresh my knowledge in Git since we haven't really used it too much at I. 
We've already talked to the IT students and they will have a quick crash course with us! :D

Q2: How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- First, I'll need to understand what I know, that the other might not (or at least something I have another perspective on).
After this I can share my knowledge, perspective, and offer help when needed!

Q3: What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- My contribution will be to make sure that I do the best in learning how to use Scrum myself. I've been on lectures and the minetest exercise. 
By doing this I can then spread that knowledge when working in the group. 

Q4: What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- We have not yet started with the project. But I was involved during the meeting when the group created the group contract together.
