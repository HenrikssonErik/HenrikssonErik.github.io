What do I want to learn or understand better?
  As we move more towards a complete template of the website, we have to connect it with some sort of database. So I want to learn more HTML, CSS and TS using Angular, 
  but also the database language MongoDB, and the linking between the two.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  Participate per usual and try to help wherever I can

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
  I have been part of trying to split our big user stories to smaller, more digestible ones, sice we started with far too big and vague user stories.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
  Me and Malte fixed the routing of our website (the pages that are in work atm), as well as started making a news feed for our start page (not connected to a database)
