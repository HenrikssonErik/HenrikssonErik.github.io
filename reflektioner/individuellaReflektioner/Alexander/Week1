What do I want to learn or understand better?
  As this was the first week of the project, it has mostly come down to getting to know the people in the group a little better.
  Furthermore I am looking to understand and effectively work with the scrum process to get a robust and agile way of working during the whole course.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  Since all of us have different backgrounds, so as an IT-student, with a bit more experience with the project process, 
  I will mostly help with the general tools of collaborating, such as GitHub and Trello to get everyone on the same page.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
  I need to understand the general idea of Scrum to make the coming weeks more productive 

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
  Took part in making the social contract
