What do I want to learn or understand better?

  At the moment I'm getting to know the group and have just started thinking about these things.
  Right now I want to learn the Github workflow better so that we can get that going.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

  I'm open to answering all questions with an open mind in this early stage of the project. I'm also a happy boy.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

  Right now only discussing what we've been taught in class, explaining what i have understood to someone if they have not understood.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

  Helped form the initial social contract. Started planning toward the project.
