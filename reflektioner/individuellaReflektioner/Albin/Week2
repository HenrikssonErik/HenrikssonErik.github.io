What do I want to learn or understand better?
  I want to learn the Github workflow even better, even though I have learned a lot in the first week.
  I also want to practice and get better at HTML, CSS and Typescript, as well as the Scrum workflow.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  I think us three I-students will help eachother a lot in the beginning to get the workflow going well.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  I'm quite good with structure so I can help keeping the structure together.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  In the beginning I will write HTML code. For now I've just learned the working environment and helped contribute to the project scope.
