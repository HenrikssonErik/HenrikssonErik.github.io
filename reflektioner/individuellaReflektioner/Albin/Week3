# Week 3

## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

I would like to get a better understanding of connecting the frontend with the backend, eg. making the HTML-form send an email when submitted.

## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

By explaining the topics I've understood to the team members who haven't.

## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I'm very conserned with the fact that at the end of each sprint the product must be shippable to the client and not WIP.

## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I've been writing HTML and CSS and slightly started looking at the backend-side of things.
