What do I want to learn or understand better?
  After this sprint I would like to understand hashing better. It was under my userstory this sprint and it was a lot to take in as a complete beginner in hashing.
  

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  I can help my self but also the team understand the process of hashing and such since I will continue with hashing the password on the serverside this week. 

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
 This week I believe I was lacking a little bit in the scrum proccess. Our task's was a bit big but I will continue to work on my scrum teqchniques in the weeks 
 that's coming up. I did do everything that I set out to do though, and went to the meetings. 

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
  Sebastian and I worked on hashing the password on the client-side. First we just had to understand the whole process and then we delivered. It was quite a hassle there 
  for a while but all went well in the end. I have also contacted schack.se in order to get a hold of their api's. But they haven't responded yet underfortunately.
