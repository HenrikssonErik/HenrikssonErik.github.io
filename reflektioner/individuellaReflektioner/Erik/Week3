What do I want to learn or understand better?
  First and foremost I would like to learn TS and Angular. I would also like to further my HTML and CSS knowledge. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  Just be there if someone needs help with something. Look up solutions to current problems etc. 

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
  I have been part of trying to split our big user stories to smaller, more digestible ones, sice we started with far too big and vague user stories.
  I have moved our cards, been to the meetings, discussed issues, gotten a clearer pictures as product owner and just been a part of team.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
 Ida and I created the calendar page and fixed everything with that.
