What do I want to learn or understand better?
- Git, scrum and life. Also I will have to renew my HTML and CSS knowledge. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I guess we will have to find out. I will just keep on working and do my best. I believe we all will help each other when we can. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I went to the meetings, wrote some userstories and was on the "git-workshop"

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- I worked on the prototype.
