1.What do I want to learn and understand better?

This early in the course I would say the learning objectives for the forseeable future has to be 
focused on learning the scrum work process. 

2.How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

In the beginning of the project i belive that it willl be very important to share knowledge about
tools for collaboratins (Git, trello-board etc) and as an IT-student we have had project courses before
where we have used these tools can therefor present this to the group as (possibly) useful tools.

3.What is  my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum

To begin with I need to get a good understanding of the Scrum work-cycle to be able to use it effectively
in the coming projcet.

4. What is my contirbution towards the teams' deliveries?

Social contract to begin with and project idea for the coming week.
