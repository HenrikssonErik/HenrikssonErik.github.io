1.What do I want to learn and understand better?
This week we have started to make the site more usable by beginning to integrate admin users that can post information without having to do it in the sourcecode. 
My role in this process is creating the log-in system and in that process we had to learn a bit about security measures both on front/backend and I will have to continue
this process next sprint.

2.How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
At our mid-sprint meeting we ussualy go through what we done so far and what the tehcniques that are used so this is a good place to share information to the rest
of the team for them to get a basic understanding of it. So next sprint my part in this would probably be focused on sharing my new insights on user security.


3.What is  my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum
I got the feeling that we have imporved our scrum methods a lot compared to the first sprint but one thing that we still miss out on is valuating how much time that is 
needed on a task. 

4. What is my contirbution towards the teams' deliveries?
As mentioned in question 1 my contributions this sprint is on the log-in system where we have researched hashingmethods and created a login page. And next sprint
we will contninue on a "create-account" page and more security.
