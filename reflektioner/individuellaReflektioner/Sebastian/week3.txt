1.What do I want to learn and understand better?
We realized during this sprint that our userstories need to be modified a bit due to some being to broad and unspesific. 
So this is definatly something i would like to improve my understanding of.

2.How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Most of the basic HTML/CSS were completed during this sprint so now we get into more technical details and will now enter
a more technical part of the development process and when we all have different levels of knowledge about possible solutions
I belive that it will be very important to share and discuss this to broaden everyones knowledge about the subject and open up for 
possible solutions.

3.What is  my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum
We have discussed a bit about how we should use our scrumboard and it's layout during this week and therefor we could present 
our ideas to improve our scrumprocess. We will probably evalute our current scrum system at the next meeting to further streamline this process.

4. What is my contirbution towards the teams' deliveries?
This week I was part of the team that created the navbar to simplify navigation for our users which was one if this sprints user stories.
